# April 11: Analysis, part 1
### Numeric variables and linear association

Step beyond data wrangling and visualization and into the world of statistical analysis. Can we use the data we cleaned, collected, and described to answer empirical questions? Part 1 covers analysis of numeric variables: summary stats, difference of means, ANOVA, and linear regression. When should we use these tools, how do we execute the tests, and how do we present the results to a general audience? Although I will review some of the statistical concepts (e.g. basics of OLS regression), I assume that youâ€™re familiar with, for example, interpreting a slope coefficient in regression analysis, or understanding p-values in, e.g., a difference of means (t) test.

Looking ahead, part 2 will cover interaction effects, categorical predictors, tabular analysis, and transformations.
