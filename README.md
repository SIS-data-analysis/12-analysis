# April 11/18: Analysis
### Description, inference, and linear association

Step beyond data wrangling and visualization and into the world of statistical analysis. Can we use the data we cleaned, collected, and described to answer empirical questions? Part 1 covers analysis of numeric variables: summary stats, difference of means, ANOVA, and linear regression. Part 2 will cover interaction effects, categorical predictors, tabular analysis, and transformations.
